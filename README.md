This project is a static webpage developed as the **second milestone assignment** for the **Programming Hero Web Development Course (Level 1)**. It builds upon the first assignment by focusing on **Responsive Web Design (RWD)** techniques using pure **HTML and CSS**.

**Live Demo:** [https://mahinanowar.github.io/demo-responsive-site/](https://mahinanowar.github.io/demo-responsive-site/)

## About The Project

This webpage serves as a practical exercise in making web layouts adapt to different device screen sizes. It demonstrates fundamental RWD concepts learned in the course. Key aspects include:

*   A layout that adjusts based on viewport width.
*   Content stacking or resizing for smaller screens.
*   Navigation adjustments (if applicable) for mobile views.
*   Implementation achieved purely through CSS, without external frameworks or JavaScript.

## Assignment Context

*   **Course:** Programming Hero Web Development Course (Level 1)
*   **Milestone/Assignment:** 2
*   **Objective:** To practice and implement **responsive web design** techniques using primarily **CSS Media Queries**.
*   **Requirement:** Achieve responsiveness for common device breakpoints (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop) using CSS only.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For structuring the content.
*   **CSS3:** For styling the page, including:
    *   Layout (potentially using Flexbox or Grid, depending on course coverage)
    *   Appearance (colors, fonts, backgrounds)
    *   **Media Queries:** To apply different styles based on screen size.

## Features

*   Semantic HTML structure.
*   CSS for styling and layout.
*   **Responsive layout** adapting to different screen sizes.
*   Use of **CSS Media Queries** to handle breakpoints.
*   Multiple distinct content sections adapting responsively.
*   Cross-browser compatibility (basic testing assumed).
